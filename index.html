<div style="position:absolute;left:70.58px;top:594.70px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">According to Indrani Debi, the comet had not proved to be disastrous because of the </span><span class="cls_015">yajna</span><span class="cls_003">that had been performed in their house.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:71.06px;top:605.38px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">No, the </span><span class="cls_015">yajna</span><span class="cls_003"> had no impact upon the comet. The project undertaken by the scientists prevented the comet from colliding with the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:70.58px;top:150.62px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">Duttada's general outlook was rational. He did not believe in superstitions. He only believed in what he saw and in his calculations.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:71.06px;top:161.18px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">When Indrani Debi said that she wished he had not discovered the comet as it brought ill-luck, he laughed and said that even an</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:70.58px;top:189.86px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">Later when Indrani Debi asked him to perform a </span><span class="cls_015">yajna</span><span class="cls_003">so that the comet would not harm him, he reacted very angrily. He said that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:71.06px;top:200.54px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">such superstitious behaviour could be understood in the olden times because back then man did not know the true nature of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:71.06px;top:211.22px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">comets. However, in modern times, such behaviour was unacceptable. He said that it had been clearly established by statistical</span></div>
